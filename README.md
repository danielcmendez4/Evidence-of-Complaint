# WARNING: I have been the victim of the Lehman College Email Scams (Phishing Scams)

On Tuesday, October 8, 2024, between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM, I got a notification warning that my Lehman College email account might be terminated. The message was invalid but conveyed a sense of urgency, suggesting immediate action was needed to avoid this outcome. As my Lehman College email is a vital tool for communication and accessing essential resources, this message caused significant shocking. Due to its formal tone and reference to institutional policies, I initially believed the email might be legitimate. 

Two days later, on October 10, 2024, at 10:37 AM, I received a text message claiming to be from the Lehman College Information Technology (IT) Department. The message stated, **This is a short verification process from the Lehman College Information Technology Department aimed at identifying and terminating phishing accounts. You have just submitted your educational details for verification to secure your account from termination.** The professional tone made the message appear credible and heightened my concern about losing access to my account. Trusting the sender, I followed the provided instructions. Shortly afterward, I received another message containing a Microsoft authentication code, with instructions to use it for identity verification. Despite some hesitation, the urgency and apparent legitimacy of the request convinced me to comply. I entered the code as instructed and received a follow-up message - **I will get back to you on the status on the account** - assuring me that I would be notified about the account's status. 

However, about two hours later, I attempted to log in and encountered an error message stating, **Your account has been locked. Contact your support person to unlock it, then try again.** At this point, it became clear that my account had been compromised in a phishing scam designed to steal my credentials and lock me out. 

In an effort to regain access, I tried the **Forgot your password** option on the sign-in page. After entering my Lehman College email and completing the CAPTCHA - Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. I clicked **Next** and was met with a troubling message: **Your account is currently blocked from signing in. You cannot reset your password at this time. Please contact an admin in your organization to unblock your account.** 

This incident has been deeply distressing. My Lehman College email is vital for academic, professional, and personal purposes. It contains important documents, including academic records and communications with professors. Being locked out has severely disrupted my ability to complete assignments, access college resources, and maintain communication with instructors, advisors, and peers. I need assistance immediately in recovering access to my email account and investigating any unauthorized activities to prevent further misuse. Additionally, I would appreciate guidance on putting stronger security measures, such as enhanced authentication protocols, to protect my account from future attacks. This situation underscores the need for vigilance against phishing scams, and I hope Lehman College's IT Department can resolve this issue promptly and effectively.
